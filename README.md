This is an aggregation of cheatsheets to be used as a reference.  It will be mostly helpful to Computer Science students, Programmers, Developers, or Data Scientists.

The cheatsheets cover various subjects such as **math**(from algebra to linear agebra and more), **computer science**(python, js, css, html, python libraries, algorithms, networking, and more), **devops**(git, github, dockers, vagrant, and more), and the list keeps growing.  

Some simple cheatsheets are included in this readme file, while most will be in the folders above.
