# Linear Algebra

## Linear Systems in 2 unknowns
A `linear system` variables are linear (first degree, raised to the power of 1).

#### Substitution Method
1. get a variable by itself.
2. substitute the result you got into the other equation.
3. solve equation in step 2 for remaining variable.
4. use result from step 3 & plug in equation from step 1.

Example

Find the unique solution to the system of equations.
$y = x + 3$
$2x - 3y = 10$
